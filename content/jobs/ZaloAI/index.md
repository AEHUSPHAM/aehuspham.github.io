- Developed vision language models for image captioning, OCR and vision question answering. Our model achieve 42.6, which is the highest results on [MTVQA](https://github.com/tanminhtran168/Vi-MTVQA)

- Led development of KiLM for Vietnamese language tasks, focusing on dialogue systems. In this project, we improve our model upto 95% of GPT-4o ability on our in-house benchmark, which is based on [TencentLMEval](https://github.com/xsysigma/TencentLLMEval.git)

- Preparing synthetic data for fine-tuning KiLM, which lead this model achieves 66.07, surpass GPT-4 on [VMLU](https://vmlu.ai/leaderboard), utilizing techniques such as instruction tuning and synthetic data generation.

- In charge of preparing the pre-training data for pre-training KiLM, our Large Language Model. KiLM was trained on massive text data collected from various domains. Furthermore, I work on research about different domain weighting strategies to pre-training a LLM.
